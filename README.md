# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. By analyzing customer behavior, the project segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing patterns, helping businesses tailor marketing strategies to specific customer groups. The analysis is performed using Python for data preprocessing and clustering.

## Project Workflow
## 1. Data Preprocessing (Python)
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
- Cleaned and preprocessed the customer dataset, handling missing values and normalizing features.
- Selected key features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score for clustering.

## 2. K-Means Clustering (Python)
- Implemented the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into clusters.
- Used the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Visualized the clusters and analyzed the characteristics of each segment.
  
## 3. Data Visualization (Python)
- Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to display customer segmentation by age, income, and spending score.
- Visualized the clusters in a 2D space to show how different customer groups are formed.
  
## Key Insights

- Customer Segments: Identified distinct customer groups with unique spending and income characteristics.
- Marketing Strategy: Insights into customer behavior, enabling personalized marketing strategies for each segment.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python: For data cleaning, clustering, and visualization (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn).
- K-Means Algorithm: For customer segmentation.

## Files in this Repository

- Customer_Segmentation.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with Python code for clustering and analysis.
- Mall_Customers.csv: The dataset used for segmentation.
- Customer_Segmentation.png: Image showing the customer segments visualized in 2D space.
  
## Future Work

- Explore other clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering.
- Integrate additional features like customer purchase frequency and preferences for more detailed segmentation.
